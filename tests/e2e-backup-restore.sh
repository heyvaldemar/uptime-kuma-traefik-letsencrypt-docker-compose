# End-to-end tests for the uptime-kuma-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose
# backup + restore flow.
#
# This application keeps everything it knows in one directory: a SQLite file
# and a few upload folders. There is no database server to dump, so the archive
# IS the database, and the test that matters is whether a file written before a
# backup comes back after a restore that has since destroyed it.
#
# Requires: docker, docker compose. Assumes the stack is already up with short
# backup intervals in .env (CI uses INIT_SLEEP=15s, INTERVAL=60s).
#
#   ./tests/e2e-backup-restore.sh
#
# Tests are dispatched indirectly via run_test "$name"; shellcheck cannot trace
# that and flags every function as unused (SC2329).
# shellcheck disable=SC2329
